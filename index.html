  Researchers estimate that about half of all pregnancies are unplanned, even though 90 percent of women use some form of birth control. Because unplanned pregnancies are so common, many women drink before they know they are pregnant. That's why the CDC recommends that women avoid alcohol if they are sexually active and not using effective contraception.

  Two fetuses may be exposed to the same amount and type of alcohol at the same time during pregnancy and experience very different effects. Experts believe that genetics play a role in determining the extent to which a fetus is affected by alcohol in the womb. There is currently no way to predict how an individual fetus will be affected.
